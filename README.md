###### Reservoir Computing . Chaos . Noise . Fractals
-----------------------------------------------
Study and Implementation of Deterministic and non deterministic Noise. Fractals. And Reservoir computing.


------------------------------------------------
 ###### Questions
-----------------------------------------------
  1. Could noise induce or reduce chaos ?
  2. Stochastic noise, Random noise, (non)deterministic chaos and effect on predictability or system prediction and behaviour
  3. Identifying or distinguishing noise from chaos.
  4. Could models  (ESN or LSTM for example) still predict nondeterministic and chaotic system ?
  5. Understanding Fractals. And how useful they are to Machine learning
